                </dd>

                <dt> Plank </dt>
                <dd> Planks build your core strength. To perform a plank, get in a push up position amd rest your forearms on the floor. Hold the position as long as you can.
                </dd>

                <dt> Mountain Climbers </dt>
                <dd> Mountain climbers are a good cardio excerise. Place your hands on the floor in a push up position, then bring one knee up to your chest and then switch as quickly as you can (as though you are climbing a mountain).
